# CS225

Hi, I am a U of I CompE student. I am in CS225 SP2017.

Hopefully you are reading this file before you are about to do any "evil things" like ctrl+c, ctrl+v with my code, change some variables and call it yours.

So basically DON'T DO THAT. You'll get caught, the best you'll get is getting a 0 on the MP or lose a full letter grade, the worst is EXPULSION. Simply not worth it if you do the math. I claim absolutely no respsibility because that's YOUR CHOICE.

I am only posting my work for your inspiration about data structures.

Also I do not guarantee my work is perfect - there might be a few minor mistakes.
